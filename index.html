  <p>    Welcome to <strong><em>Raaga Sudha School of Music.</em></strong></p>
  <p>
    I began Raaga Sudha in 2007, as a salutation to that  undiscovered melody within each of us. From the child swaying to the beat of  cinema music to the adult lost in a Thaygaraja krithi, from a young, hesitant  voice singing the first swarams to the spiritual group rendering a Mira Bhajan,  each of us has a note of music deep within us waiting to spring out. Raaga Sudha  is my tribute to the hidden music with all of you. </p>
  <p>    Raaga Sudha School of Music was formed to teach, encourage  and appreciate Carnatic music in all its forms: classical, folk and  semi-classical to anyone who is interested and willing to explore. Raaga Sudha  is more than just a place where we sing a few notes and rush back to our  routines. It’s where I hope to teach young and old the beauty of music, the  peace it brings and the delight of discovering it within ourselves. </p>
  <p>  The rush of everyday life is inevitable, but the moments you  spend here learning and exploring the music of your choice will stay with you    through your chores  </p>

  <p>    There will be learning, there will competitions. There will  be discussions, there will be exchanges. It will be your special place to learn  and appreciate music the way we appreciate it. The way I learnt it.</p>
